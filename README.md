Figure 2A contains heatmap based on previuosly published RNAseq data:

1. PTI - Bjornson et al. 2021 The transcriptional landscape of Arabidopsis thaliana pattern-triggered immunity; (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-021-00874-5); Supplementary Table 1 was used
2. ETI - Ngou et al. 2021 Mutual potentiation of plant immunity by cell-surface and intracellular receptors; (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03315-7); raw RNAseq data were used, ENA/SRA ID - PRJEB34955
3. PTI+ETI - Saile et al. 2020 Two unequally redundant "helper" immune receptor families mediate Arabidopsis thaliana intracellular "sensor" immune receptor functions; (https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000783); raw data were used, ENA/SRA ID - PRJNA637584
